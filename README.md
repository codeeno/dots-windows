# Dotfiles for Windows

This repository contains some configs from my Windows setup for the purpose of simplifying a fresh install.

## Setting up Git and cloning this repository

To clone this repository:

1. Install Git:

    ```powershell
    winget install -e --id Git.Git
    ```

2. Open a new terminal session and run:

    ```powershell
    git config --global user.email "<email>"
    git config --global user.name "<username>"
    ```
3. (Optional) If not already present, create a directory for Git projects. *If done via the below command, this needs to be done with the terminal opened as an administrator*:

    ```powershell
    New-Item C:\Projects
    ```
4. Clone the repository and `cd` into it:
    ```powershell

    ```

## Winget packages

### Installing packages from export file

To install the packages from export file contained within this repo, `cd` into the root of this repository and run:

```powershell
winget import --no-upgrade -i .\packages\winget_packages.json
```

### Saving installed packages to export file

There is a script in this repository which exports all currently installed packages to a file and, if changes are detected, creates a commit and pushes the changes to Github. To run the script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\packages\update_packages_json.ps1
```

### Upgrading packages

```powershell
# Listing available upgrades
winget upgrade --include-unknown

# Upgrading a specific package
winget upgrade 'Dev Home'

# Upgrading all packages
winget upgrade --all
```

### Automatically exporting packages as a scheduled task

This repository also includes a script which creates a task in the Windows Task Scheduler to periodically run the script which exports the current packages to a file. To set it up:

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\dots-windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\packages\schedule_task_update_packages_json.ps1
```

## Custom keyboard layouts

### Layouts

* US with Umlauts: This layout is a copy of the regular US layout, but adds `AltGr + u` as a deadkey to make Umlauts, e.g. `AltGr + u --> a` to produce `Ã¤`.

### Installing a layout

The layouts were created using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msklc-guide.github.io) (MSKLC) which can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134). *Note: At the time of this writing, there isn't yet an available Winget package for MSKLC.*

1. Install MSKLC from the aforementioned Link and launch it
2. Load the desired `*.klc` file using `File > Load Source File...`
3. Build the installer for the layout using `Project > Build DLL and Setup Package`
4. Run the newly created `setup.exe` to install the layout

The layout can then be added to the language options in the Windows settings.

## Fan control config

This repository contains a config file for [Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/). The main reason for using it over setting up the fan curve in BIOS is to be able to use the `mix` function which Fan Control provides. This enables me to base the curve for my case fans on both the CPU and GPU sensors at the same time (based on whichever is higher). 

To set up the profile, it's easiest to simply load the `config.json` inside the program using the path to this repo. That way, if the config is updated, we can directly do a commit to version the change.

## TODO
* Make the scheduled task script not flash a command line window to the user when it runs. This can be done by wrapping it in a `cmd` call. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67300159
* Make the scheduled task produce a log file. This has kind of worked before, also using `cmd`. See: https://superuser.com/a/1622540
